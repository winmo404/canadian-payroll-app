## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 🔐 **PHASE 1: Multi-Company Authentication (REQUIRED FIRST)**
**Must complete before any UI changes**

1. **Create Authentication System**
   - Files: Multiple new files (see MULTI-COMPANY-SYSTEM.md)
   - Impact: Transforms entire application architecture
   - Requirements: User accounts, password security, data isolation

2. **Implement Company Data Isolation**
   - Files: New hooks and storage system
   - Impact: Separate data for each company
   - Requirements: Company-specific data storage

3. **Add Login/Registration UI**
   - Files: Authentication components
   - Impact: User can create accounts and login
   - Requirements: Secure authentication flow

### 🎨 **PHASE 2: UI Improvements (After Authentication)**

4. **Fix Logout Popup Positioning**
   - File: `src/components/auth/AuthWrapper.tsx`
   - Change: `absolute` to `fixed` positioning
   - Impact: Users can actually logout

5. **Fix Text Contrast Issues**
   - File: `src/components/auth/AuthWrapper.tsx`
   - Change: White text to dark text
   - Impact: Header text is readable

6. **Remove Storage Manager**
   - File: `src/app/page.tsx`
   - Change: Remove import and component
   - Impact: Cleaner interface

7. **Header Alignment**
